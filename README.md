# Leveraging-Historical-Trends-for-No-Sales-Season-Resolution

## Business context:
Facing a recurring challenge mirroring the 2014 sales trend, our company anticipates a 'No Sales Season' from August to December. This cyclic downturn has historically hindered financial growth and operational stability.

## Problem Statement and Objective:
Our company has committed to operating throughout the year to ensure a steady and continuous flow of sales. To achieve this, we have set out to identify the products that have the potential for increased demand during historically slower months. By identifying these items, we aim to optimize restocking strategies, ensuring a consistent revenue stream throughout the year.
